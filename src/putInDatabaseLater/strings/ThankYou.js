    "I grew up with the internet. I knew arin from his animator days as egoraptor. I started watching when he started game grumps with jon, but stopped watching when jon left the show. I was one of those guys who were pretty pissed about jon leaving. But then i started watching them again on and off for a while until that wind waker episode. I love both dan and arin. They shaped me as a person. And im glad they did.",
    "I was in fifth grade when I first found out about the grumps. I was really really sick in bed and I had been for a few weeks. So I naturally wanted to look up let's play's of one of my favorite games at the time. Super Mario 3d World. and i found the grumps. \n  They made me laugh the hardest I had in a long time. I am eternally thankful for that.",
